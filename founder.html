                    <div class="founder-bio">
                        <p>I started MelodyHub because I wanted to make music education accessible to everyone. I've been singing for years, and it changed my life—but I realized not everyone gets that chance. Some can't afford lessons, and some communities don't get live music. That bothered me, so I decided to do something about it.</p>

                        <p>It all began when I started helping friends learn to sing, just casually. But I kept seeing the same thing: people would come in thinking they couldn't sing, and leave with confidence. I saw how music builds connection and brings joy, but these benefits weren't reaching everyone. That's when I realized I needed to create something more structured.</p>

                        <p>MelodyHub came from a simple question: what if everyone could experience what singing does for me? So I started teaching lessons, performing at nursing homes and community centers, and really focusing on reaching people who don't usually get access to music programs. We're figuring it out one voice at a time.</p>

                        <p>As a high school student, this is my first real venture into leading something. I'm learning as I go, but here's what I've figured out: real leadership isn't about having a title. It's about seeing a need and doing something about it. Every lesson I teach, every performance I give, every connection I make—it reminds me why this matters so much.</p>

                        <p>I want MelodyHub to be more than just a music program. I want it to show that every voice matters and every community deserves music. I'm committed to growing it thoughtfully—not just getting bigger, but staying true to what makes it special: the personal connection and genuine care for each person we reach.</p>

                            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Music should be for everyone, period. No barriers based on money, age, or background</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why I'm Passionate About Music Education</h2>
            <div class="journey-content">
                <p>Music has always been part of my life, but I didn't really understand its power until I started teaching others. Watching a student go from "I can't do this" to performing confidently, seeing a nursing home resident's face light up when they recognize a song, watching people connect over music—these are the moments that make MelodyHub worth it.</p>
                
                <p>I really believe everyone has a voice worth sharing. When I first started performing at cafes and community spaces, I saw how music brings people together—even people who don't speak the same language or come from different backgrounds. Teaching has been just as powerful. It's amazing to watch how learning to sing builds confidence that changes how someone carries themselves everywhere, not just when they're singing.</p>

                <p>MelodyHub is my way of making sure everyone can access what music gave me: confidence, connection, joy, and growth. Especially people who might not get that opportunity otherwise. As we grow, I'm working hard to keep that personal touch—every lesson matters, every performance matters, every person matters.</p>
