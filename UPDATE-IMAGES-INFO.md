# Image File Information Needed

Since I can't directly see your image files, I need you to provide the **actual filenames** so I can update the HTML code to use them correctly.

## Please provide:

### Hero folder (`images/hero/`):
- List the filename(s) in this folder: _______________

### Performances folder (`images/performances/`):
- List all filenames: _______________

### Community folder (`images/community/`):
- List all filenames: _______________

### Teaching folder (`images/teaching/`):
- List all filenames (if any): _______________

## OR

You can run this command in PowerShell from the `images` folder to list them:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\dnsja\hubmelody-website\images
.\list-images.ps1
```

Or just tell me the filenames you see in each folder, and I'll update all the HTML files to use them!
