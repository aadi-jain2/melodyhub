                        <p>I teach lessons to students of all ages and skill levels. Some people have never sung before, and others just want to improve. Either way, I help them find their voice and build confidence. We work on technique, sure, but the real focus is on helping people feel comfortable expressing themselves.</p>

                                <strong>How it works:</strong> I teach both one-on-one and small group sessions, depending on what works best for each student

                            <div class="feature-item">
                                <strong>When:</strong> Weekly lessons, and I'm pretty flexible with scheduling—I know life gets busy!

                            <div class="feature-item">
                                <strong>What we work on:</strong> Vocal technique, breath control, learning songs, but most importantly, building confidence to actually perform

                            <div class="feature-item">
                                <strong>Who can join:</strong> Middle schoolers through adults, and honestly, I don't care if you've never sung a note—everyone starts somewhere
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p class="program-impact">So far, I've worked with over 50 students, and it's amazing to see how many of them went from being too shy to sing to performing confidently in front of others. That confidence spills into other areas of their lives too—it's pretty cool to watch.</p>

                        <h2>Community Performances</h2>
                        <p>I perform at places that don't usually get live music—nursing homes, community centers, local cafes, and special events. These aren't just gigs for me; they're chances to connect with people who really appreciate the music. The response is always incredible.</p>
                        <div class="program-features">

                                <strong>Where I perform:</strong> Nursing homes, assisted living facilities, community centers, and local cafes—basically anywhere that needs music

                            <div class="feature-item">
                                <strong>How often:</strong> I try to do at least one performance a month, plus special events when opportunities come up

                            <div class="feature-item">
                                <strong>What I sing:</strong> I mix it up—classic songs people know and love, some newer stuff, and I always take requests. If someone wants to hear a specific song, I'll learn it if I don't know it
                            </div>
                            <div class="feature-item">
                                <strong>The impact:</strong> Each performance usually reaches 15-40 people, and honestly, just seeing their faces makes it all worth it
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p class="program-impact">I've done over 25 performances so far, reaching more than 200 people. But the numbers aren't what matter—it's the moments: someone singing along to a song they haven't heard in years, or a resident telling me how much they needed this.</p>

                        <h2>Music Outreach & Accessibility</h2>
                        <p>This is what matters most to me: making music accessible to everyone. Some people think they can't afford lessons or that they're "too old" or "not talented enough." I work hard to break down those barriers because music shouldn't be exclusive—it should be for everyone.</p>

                                <strong>Who we focus on:</strong> Elderly in care facilities, students whose families can't afford traditional lessons, and anyone else who doesn't usually get access to music programs
                            </div>
                            <div class="feature-item">
                                <strong>How we make it work:</strong> I offer sliding-scale pricing (pay what you can), work around people's schedules, and really listen to what each community needs
                            </div>
                            <div class="feature-item">
                                <strong>Working together:</strong> I partner with local facilities and organizations to figure out what's actually needed—not what I think they need, but what they tell me they want
                            </div>

                        <p class="program-impact">Bottom line: music education shouldn't be a privilege. It should be something everyone can access, regardless of their situation. That's what I'm working toward.</p>
