## Step 5: Future Updates

Whenever you make changes to your website:

2. Open GitHub Desktop

7. Your website will update automatically within a few minutes!

## Important Note About Videos

If GitHub Desktop shows an error about large files (videos > 100MB):
- Videos might be too large for GitHub
- You can either:
  1. Remove videos from the commit (they'll stay on your computer)
  2. Upload videos to YouTube/Vimeo and embed them instead
  3. Use GitHub LFS for large files (more advanced)
