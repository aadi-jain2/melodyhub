## 📍 **Where to Put Your Image Files**

Put all your image files in the **`images`** folder inside the `hubmelody-website` directory.

### Folder Structure:

      ├── performances/   ← All performance photos
      ├── teaching/       ← Teaching/lesson photos  
      └── community/      ← Community events, nursing homes, cultural events

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\dnsja\hubmelody-website\images\`

2. **Place your images in the appropriate folders**:
   - **Stage performance photos** → `hero/` folder
   - **Cafe/venue performances** → `performances/` folder
   - **Teaching sessions** → `teaching/` folder
   - **Nursing home visits, cultural events** → `community/` folder

3. **Name your files descriptively** (optional, but helpful):
   - Examples: `hero-stage.jpg`, `performance-cafe-1.jpg`, `teaching-lesson.jpg`

4. **Once files are uploaded**, let me know and I'll:
   - Update all HTML pages to use your actual images
   - Replace all placeholder images
   - Optimize image paths across the site

## 🎯 **Based on Your Current Photos**

Based on the 12 images you've shown me, here's the suggested placement:

### Hero Image (Home Page Banner):

- Theatrical curtain call → `images/performances/performance-theatrical.jpg`

### Community Events:
- Cultural performances (traditional attire) → `images/community/community-cultural-1.jpg` and `community-cultural-2.jpg`

## 💡 **Tips**
- Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
- For best quality, use images at least 1200px wide
- Don't worry about exact naming - I can work with any names you choose

## ✅ **Ready?**

Once you've placed your images in the folders, just tell me "images are uploaded" and I'll integrate them into the website!
