                    <p>One of my students started so nervous they could barely sing above a whisper. A few months later, they performed confidently at three different community events. It's proof that with the right support, anyone can find their voice.</p>

                    <h3>Rediscovering Passion</h3>
                    <p>At a care facility, a resident who hadn't sung in decades started singing along during my performance. Afterwards, she told me how it brought back memories she thought she'd forgotten and made her feel like herself again. That's why I do this.</p>

                    <h3>Building Community</h3>
                    <p>Now that I perform regularly at certain nursing homes, the residents actually look forward to it. They talk about it beforehand and remember songs together. Music is helping them form connections with each other that weren't there before.</p>
